# Whack Voldy

Welcome to "Whack Voldy," a React-based interactive game inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter. This project is a personal journey through my love for coding and the Harry Potter series. As my third project, it represents a milestone where I have applied my creativity and problem-solving skills to build something fun and engaging.

## About The Project

"Whack Voldy" is crafted with the intent to merge fun with learning. In this game, players will try to "whack" Voldemort, avoiding Harry Potter at all costs to gain points. It's a simple yet captivating way to enjoy some light-hearted moments with a touch of magic.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
- Custom CSS
- Love for Harry Potter

 **Game Rules**
 <br />
